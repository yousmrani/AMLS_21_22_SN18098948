# AMLS_Coursework
This is a private repository for the AMLS coursework (2021-2022) regarding Tumor Detection and Recognition

### Task Introduction 
In this repository, we will test different Machine Learning models to solve two tasks: Brain Tumour detection and Brain Tumour classification. 

### Organisation of the files
The files in the "Notebook" folder represent the different notebooks made for each of the models. The notebooks named "binary_..." represent the models used for tumour detection while the notebooks named "Multiclass_..." represent the implemention of models used for the tumour classification. 

### How to run the code ? 
First, in order to train all the algorithms, you must download the training data from the following link: http://shorturl.at/hquDP. Put them in the same folder as the notebooks. 

Then, unzip the "test" file containing the test images and labels and put the files in the notebook folder. 

You can then proceed to run each notebook one by one. Each of the notebooks represents a specific algorithm so make sure to run them all in order to compare them !
